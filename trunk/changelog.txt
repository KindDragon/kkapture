version 0.04alpha:
* some performance improvements for directdraw capturing
* several bugfixes
* new directshow-based avi writer, currently the only one available (0.04 final will have both the old and new avi writer)
* automatic audio resampling (required for dshow, currently converts everything to 16bit 44.1kHz stereo)
* new timing code (not particularly well tested yet!)

version 0.03:
* waveout capturing finally works (now that was one stupid bug)
* directdraw/old d3d support (both software and hardware)
* kkapture now sets the executables' directory as current working dir before starting
* "skip silence" option added (required for e.g. fr-08); currently only works for
  directsound
* "make sleeps last one frame" option added (required for some old BASS and FMOD
  versions to work correctly)
* the .bmp/.wav writer now compensates for frames at the beginning without sound
* capture audio/capture video flags

version 0.02:
* direct xvid/divx encoding works now.
* windowed capture support for both opengl and d3d - beware, some demos do not use correct window sizes in windowed mode, so you get e.g. a 630x472 capture for a 640x480 demo - most video codecs don't like sizes that aren't multiples of 4.
* opengl capturing bugfix - on swapbuffers(), frames were accidentially advanced twice.
* some QueryPerformanceCounter-related fixes.
* vastly improved Direct3D9 capture speed.
* Direct3D8 support (co-written by kb/farbrausch).
* .bmp/.wav output added (uncompressed highres captures easily hit the avifile 4gb limit).
* lots of tiny fixes here and there. 

version 0.01:
* initial release; still missing d3d8, ddraw support, waveout completely untested.
