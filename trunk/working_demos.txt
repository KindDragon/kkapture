checked and not working:
- the nonstop ibiza experience/orange (crashes after fractals part for no discernible reason)
- abcdemo/the project (uses GDI for rendering)
- sprite-o-mat/alcatraz (hangs on first frame, presumably due to problems with kkapture sound code)
- leitmotiv/lunix (extremely weird ddraw code that doesn't work with kkapture active and shouldn't work without kkapture active, either)
